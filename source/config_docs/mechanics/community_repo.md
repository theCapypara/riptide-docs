# Riptide Community Repository

The [Riptide Community Repository] is the default repository for Riptide.

It contains many helpful apps, services and commands maintained by the community. This part
of the guide will use entities from this repository to build projects.

A list of all entities can be found [here](../../repo_docs).

**Is something missing from the repository?** Feel free to fork the repository and
add the things you need. Or set up your own and use both. If you built something, please
contribute to the community repository to make it even better!
