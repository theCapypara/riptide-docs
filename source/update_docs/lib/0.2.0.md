## Using configuration files in commands

Previously it was possible to use configuration files defined for services in commands, using the following syntax:

```{code-block} yaml
:emphasize-lines: 10-13

 app:
   services:
     example:
       config:
         env_php:
           from: assets/env.php
           to: '{{ get_working_directory() }}/app/etc/env.php'
   commands:
     dummy:
       additional_volumes:
         env_php:
           host: "{{ parent().services.example.config('env_php') }}"
           container: "{{ parent().services.example.get_working_directory() }}/app/etc/env.php"
```

This is no longer possible, due to issues related to this functionality. Instead, you can use this new syntax, which will
add all configuration files of the services tagged with the listed roles to the command. This achieves the same goal.

```{code-block} yaml
:emphasize-lines: 4-5,12-13

 app:
   services:
     example:
       roles:
         - myrole
       config:
         env_php:
           from: assets/env.php
           to: '{{ get_working_directory() }}/app/etc/env.php'
   commands:
     dummy:
       config_from_roles:
         - myrole
```

The variable helper function `config` for [Services] has been removed. `config_from_roles` was added to the schema
for [Commands].

Detailed examples can be seen in the Riptide Community Repository commit [ee1a766](https://github.com/Parakoopa/riptide-repo/commit/ee1a766c476cf3bdab0fe422f7dae1c4b1869fc2).

The Riptide Community Repository contains a branch `0.1` that is automatically used when running `riptide update` with versions
older than 0.2. This branch is still compatible with the old version, but will not receive updates.
