Using configuration files in commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously it was possible to use configuration files defined for services in commands, using the following syntax:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 10-13

    app:
      services:
        example:
          config:
            env_php:
              from: assets/env.php
              to: '{{ get_working_directory() }}/app/etc/env.php'
      commands:
        dummy:
          additional_volumes:
            env_php:
              host: "{{ parent().services.example.config('env_php') }}"
              container: "{{ parent().services.example.get_working_directory() }}/app/etc/env.php"

This is no longer possible, due to issues related to this functionality. Instead, you can use this new syntax, which will
add all configuration files of the services tagged with the listed roles to the command. This achieves the same goal.

.. code-block:: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 4-5,12-13

    app:
      services:
        example:
          roles:
            - myrole
          config:
            env_php:
              from: assets/env.php
              to: '{{ get_working_directory() }}/app/etc/env.php'
      commands:
        dummy:
          config_from_roles:
            - myrole

The variable helper function ``config`` for Services_ has been removed. ``config_from_roles`` was added to the schema
for Commands_.

Detailed examples can be seen in the Riptide Community Repository commit `ee1a766 <https://github.com/Parakoopa/riptide-repo/commit/ee1a766c476cf3bdab0fe422f7dae1c4b1869fc2>`_.

The Riptide Community Repository contains a branch ``0.1`` that is automatically used when running ``riptide --update`` with versions
older than 0.2. This branch is still compatible with the old version, but will not receive updates.
