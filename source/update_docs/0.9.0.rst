Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

- For Linux an install script now exists to install Riptide with all dependencies and fully configure it.
- Riptide can now be installed and configured via NixOS or nix-darwin modules.
- Fixed some environment variables leaking into command containers, most notably XDG directory related variables.
- Fixed that the self updater potentially uses the wrong Python environment when trying to update.
- Fixed handling the hosts file under MacOS and Windows.
- Proxy Server: Fixed compatibility with some WebSocket applications.

Uprading
~~~~~~~~
The installation instructions have changed. The recommended way to install Riptide is via a virtualenv. If you were not using a virtualenv before
(if you don't know you most likely didn't) please read on below.

Linux
^^^^^
If you are under NixOS, you can now install Riptide as a module, see :doc:`/installation/linux_nixos`.

On other Linux distributions, uninstall Riptide packages by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo pip3 uninstall -y riptide-all riptide-cli riptide-engine-docker riptide-db-mysql riptide-db-mongo riptide-proxy riptide-lib riptide-plugin-php-xdebug

After this follow the :ref:`manual Linux installation instructions <installation/linux_any:Manual Installation>`.
Do not use the automatic installation script.

MacOS
^^^^^
First, uninstall old Riptide packages:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo pip3 uninstall -y riptide-all riptide-cli riptide-engine-docker riptide-db-mysql riptide-db-mongo riptide-proxy riptide-lib riptide-plugin-php-xdebug

Then decide on how to install Riptide:

- For MacOS the best working Riptide setup is now provided with nix-darwin. If you are comfortable using Nix you can use this,
  but please note that nix-darwin itself may still be a bit unstable at this stage. The nix-darwin setup supports automatically running
  the proxy server and supports automatically updating the hosts file. See :doc:`/installation/macos_nix_darwin` for more information.

- Alternatively you can manually install Riptide like before. Follow the :doc:`manual MacOS installation instructions </installation/macos_manual>`.
Do not use the automatic installation script. You can skip the "Shell integration" and "Systemd service" steps if you already have those set up.


Windows
^^^^^^^
Uninstall the global Riptide packages by running:

.. code-block:: powershell

    pip3 uninstall -y riptide-all riptide-cli riptide-engine-docker riptide-db-mysql riptide-db-mongo riptide-proxy riptide-lib riptide-plugin-php-xdebug

After this follow the :doc:`Windows installation instructions </installation/windows>`.
