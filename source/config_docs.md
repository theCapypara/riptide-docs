# Configuration Guide

Welcome to the Riptide Configuration Guide.

This guide will guide you through writing your own Riptide projects. It explains the mechanics
of the YAML-based configuration language and the different entities that control how Riptide projects
behave.

The Chapter [How Riptide works](config_docs/entities) explains the mechanics of the Riptide configuration
and what repositories are.

The Chapter [Entities](config_docs/entities) contains the specification of all entities.

[Examples](config_docs/using_repo) shows you how to get quickly started
by creating projects based on templates from the
[Riptide Community Repository](config_docs/using_repo).
